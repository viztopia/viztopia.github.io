                              <p class="paragraph-text">Shaker! is a WeChat Mini Program that allows you to use your
                                   phone as a shaker. It originated from a talk between me and a co-founder of Fiesta
                                   Djembe Club after an open-air performance at Flower City Square, Guangzhou. We
                                   noticed that although many of the audiences seemed to enjoy our show, only a few
                                   actually came to us and expressed their interests in the Mandingue music we played.
                                   In response, I suggested that we could make an app to strengthen the tie between us
                                   and the
                                   audience.</p>
                              <p class="paragraph-text">The app was launched in Dec 2017. Until May 2018, it had over
                                   3k UVs, and it successfully connected over 200 people with our djembe club and
                                   turned them into djembe players.</p>
                         </div>

                              <h2>User Research</h2>
                              <p class="paragraph-text">To understand what stopped the audiences from interacting with
                                   us and
                                   what might arouse their curiosity, I conducted some interviews and made several
                                   observations along our outdoor performances. The following problems were revealed:</p>
                              <br />
                              <div class="bullet-item">

                                        <li>People think the music was intriguing and if possible, they would love to
                                             try it. But without accompaniment, they felt intimidated in front of the
                                             crowd;</li>
                                        <li>Most of them hadn’t seriously played an instrument before, so they expect
                                             something easy/familiar to start with. In this case, even a simple but
                                             novice drum was a bit too much for them</li>

                              <p class="paragraph-text">The interviews were conducted between me and my students. We
                                   talked about when & where they first met this kind of music, what was their first
                                   impression, and what eventually brought them to our club to begin learning. They
                                   either noted that it would be great if we had provided them something to play with,
                                   like a small instrument, or some materials/video links about the music we played, so
                                   that they didn’t have to search it back home. They also noted that they might feel
                                   more comfortable to join if everybody played together.

                              <p class="paragraph-text">We had 1-2 performances per month on average, so this gave me
                                   quite some chances to really observe what the audiences were doing during our gigs.
                                   Most of the times they would start by taking pictures or videos, and afterwards,
                                   some would start to clap their hands along with the beat. I asked my teammates to
                                   engage the audience in different ways, and it was encouraging to see that those who
                                   were shy or hesitate to join at the beginning could end up having fun with simply a
                                   water bottle or a plastic bag with people around them. However, the phones in their
                                   hand seemed getting in their way for full hearted participation.

                              <p class="paragraph-text">Also, the participation rates among people in different age
                                   groups were noticeably different – the rate of youngsters would usually soar after
                                   our engagement, but it mostly stayed the same for elder generations.
                              </p>

                                   initial design with potential users – new audiences and students, to determin what
                                   kind of intruments should be included in the shaker. There were a vast number of
                                   instruments to choose from, even within the Mandingue Music family. Based on users'
                                   feedback, I picked three instruments
                                   that were both iconic and somewhat seemed familiar to the users – Djabara, Bell, and
                                   Djembe.
                              </p>
                              <p class="paragraph-text">The shaker design turned out to be the favored option of
                                   potential users because they thought it was more interesting to play it like an
                                   actual instrument, and it did not require staring at the screen during a live
                                   performance.
                              </p>
                              <p class="paragraph-text">In considering how
                                   to play an instrument on a phone, I checked with some popular instrument apps on the
                                   market and found that most of them used tapping/touching as the primary way of
                                   interaction. Noticing that many phones were embedded with gyroscopes or gravity
                                   sensors, I added a shaker design that would ask users to shake their phones to play
                                   a sound.
