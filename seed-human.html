            Seed: HUMAN

            Seed: HUMAN is a generative photography piece that explores the role Artificial intelligence plays in
            co-creating artworks with human.

            To tell a story in a world infiltrated by intelligent machines, through visual language, how much agency do
            we actually have as human? Are we the photographer, or simply a walking camera? Who is the artist? AI or me?
            How credible is story teller in this sense?

            this project consists of a series of images in groups of four. Two machine learning models are used in this
            project: one for interpreting the content of first image in one sentence, the other for generating a
            narrative based on that sentence. A human then attempts to visualize the whole narrative by taking 3
            subsequent photographs according to the keywords from the generated texts.</p>
