                                   at NYU ITP - we were asked to come up with our own color palette. Bearing this in
                                   mind, on a lovely Sunday afternoon of tons of sunshine, I wandered
                                   around the Rubin Museum of Arts with a friend and bumped into some magnificent
                                   pieces of Himalayan arts. As someone previously having some but not much exposure to
                                   Tibetan and Hindu culture, it was quite a fascinating and eye-opening visit. Here
                                   are just a few examples of the beautiful pieces:</p>
