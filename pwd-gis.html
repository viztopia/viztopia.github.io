                                   (PWD). The
                                   software was originally built with Adobe Flex, and we upgraded it to HTML5. Most
                                   functionalities were migrated, and several new features requested by PWD were
                                   incorporated. The goal was to provide an easy-to-use platform for utility project

                              <p class="paragraph-text">Based on user feedbacks, we adjusted the color schemes and

                                   major function. The function panel was aligned to the left side of the application
                                   to leave out more screen space for the map. Shading and shadows were used to
                                   distinguish panels with map contents.

                                   got used to their traditional way of using GIS. Therefore, we had to offer enough
                                   benefits, whether in functionality or usability, to acquire buy-ins from users and
                                   to convince them that this was a necessary change. It was not easy at first,
                                   especially when we introduced some rather novel scenarios into the application.

                                   In all, it was a great experience. We were very glad that our design was accepted by
                                   the users, and It indeed helped them to better manage their projects.
