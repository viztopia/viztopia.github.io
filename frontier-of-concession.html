                                   the struggle we have along the process of cyborgification in human society — how we
                                   first manipulate technology, then get manipulated by it, and eventually lose our
                                   intellectual territory.

                              <h2>Concept - A Battle of Intellectual Territory</h2>
                              <p class="paragraph-text">
                                   Identity-wise, I am a creative technologist who utilizes technology, especially in
                                   computer science, as tools and means for artistic expression. However, I’m also a
                                   percussionist who specializes in traditional West African music — a music form that
                                   originates from the 13th century and requires as simple as a pair of human hands and
                                   a wooden drum. As someone who is witnessing how intelligent machines gradually
                                   outperforms human in a growing number of art domains, including percussion music, I
                                   feel that our faith in human’s intellectual capability is challenged at an
                                   unprecedented level. In this case, it could mean that we can no longer claim
                                   “intelligence” as our exclusive territory.
                              </p>
                              <p class="paragraph-text">
                                   At another level, technology itself has boundaries, as it is closely connected to the
                                   social, cultural, and economical power of the country(-ies) that owns it. The process
                                   that we learn and adapt to emerging technology is, at the same, our adaptation to the
                                   culture behind it. In cases where we are forced to rely on a monopolizing technology
                                   from a tech-worshipping culture (due to societal or economic reasons), we somewhat
                                   ceded and denied the humanistic part of our territory.
                              </p>
                              <p class="paragraph-text">
                                   To convey this sense of loss of territory incurred by technology advancement, this
                                   piece incorporates two categories of technology — computer vision and
                                   sound synthesis — to recreate the battle between human and machines.

                                   Two dancers will participate: one plays the role of human, the other the role of
                                   technology. The tech dancer will use her/his hands to generate synthesized sounds,
                                   and
                                   at the same time, the hands of the tech dancer will be motion-tracked and projected
                                   onto a vertical surface, which functions as the backdrop of stage for the human
                                   dancer. The two dancers interact at both sound level and visual level.

                                   The piece was situated in a rectangular, dark room, with two performers taking up two
                                   opposite sides of it. A laptop with a webcam was set up right next to the tech dancer
                                   (located on the left), tracks her/his hand movements, and fed the movement images to
                                   the
                                   projector. The enlarged hand movement images were then projected fullsize onto a wall
                                   at the
                                   other end of the room, where the human dancer is. The audience was guided to sit in
                                   the middle of the room, facing the wall and the human dancer.

                                   An important part of this piece is to create a dialouge between tech and human
                                   through the juxtaposition of projections and a dancing body. Thus, a Max patch was
                                   created to capture and analyze the movement of a dancer's hand and transformed it
                                   into projection images that resembles the tone and feeling of technology. Midi sounds
                                   were also generated based on the hand movements.
