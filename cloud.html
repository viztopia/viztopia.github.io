                                   of the global-scaled
                                   network of computing systems backing and connecting all the digital interfaces we
                                   interact
                                   with daily, it is the representation of advance-ness - faster speed, broader access,
                                   higher efficiency, and greater connection. In it, we see a future that's more
                                   rigorous,
                                   efficient, rational, and logical. While the world enjoys the adrenaline brought by
                                   technical revolution, feelings of fatigue and languishing are also widely experienced
                                   as
                                   we are trying to catch up with the technology adaptation and overloaded information.

                                   laying on the lawn and simply observing the fluffy, cotton-like clouds slowly

                                   space, clouds constitute the broadest interconnection of the world while embodying an
