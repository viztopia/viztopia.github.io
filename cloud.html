                              <p class="paragraph-text">In an era when the “cloud'' is interpreted as the core concept
                                   of the global-scaled
                                   network of computing systems backing and connecting all the digital interfaces we
                                   interact
                                   with daily, it is the representation of advance-ness - faster speed, broader access,
                                   higher efficiency, and greater connection. In it, we see a future that's more
                                   rigorous,
                                   efficient, rational, and logical. While the world enjoys the adrenaline brought by
                                   technical revolution, feelings of fatigue and languishing are also widely experienced
                                   as
                                   we are trying to catch up with the technology adaptation and overloaded information.

                                   Are we closer to or further away from being free? Driven by the thought, the artist

                                   primitive thinking of and connection with the world.</p>

                                   Perhaps every human being had a moment of looking up to the clouds - those afternoons

                                   laying on the lawn and simply observing the fluffy, cotton-like clouds slowly
                                   floating by,
                                   constantly changing shapes. These moments draw the initial picture of the dreams of

                                   one of us. Building upon countless gazes and primitive human imagination across time
                                   and
                                   space, clouds constitute the broadest interconnection of the world while embodying an
                                   ultimate form of unrestricted freedom.</p>

                                   The trajectory of a piece of moving cloud we observed near our apartment in Brooklyn
                                   was used as the path of finding "cloud prompts" in the UMAP embeddings of Word2Vec.
                                   2D clouds were then generated using CLIP Guided Diffusion according to the prompts,
                                   and converted into 3D cloud assets for the imaginary Bureau of Cloud Management
                                   created using Unreal 5 and
                                   Cinema4D.</p>

                                   We processed the collected folklores and local cultural reports about Braga using
                                   GPT-J, an open-source text-generating ML model. Keywords with visual reference were
                                   extracted as the text prompts to be fed into a tuned CLIP-Guided Diffusion model to
                                   generate various 2D cloud shapes.

                                   The cloud shape images were later processed by a custom computer vision pipeline and
                                   turned into textures for rendering the slowly floating clouds on the website using
                                   Three.js.
