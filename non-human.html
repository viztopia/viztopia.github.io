                                   We live a life surrounded by objects we build to serve us — curtains, lamps, and many
                                   others. We use our body to interact with these objects - rubbing our face against
                                   warm towels, or sinking into a fluffy bed. We, as humans, rarely consider them to be
                                   part of us. We tend to think of ourselves as different - we’re the ones with
                                   spirituality, reason, intelligence, while they’re not.
                              </p>
                              <p class="paragraph-text">
                                   Yet, objects keep our traces, like dents in our shoes, or the erased keys on our
                                   laptop. Objects carry our memories, like an inherited music box, or a bowl with the
                                   smell of mom’s favorite recipe. Objects also shape us either physically or
                                   behaviorally: like a scar from a knife cut; or a spontaneous “sorry” when we bump
                                   into a table. All of these suggest a possible deeper connection between humans and
                                   objects, which we don’t notice on a daily basis.

                                   The advancements in modern physics have pointed out the similarity between humans and
                                   objects in terms of materiality. Emerging technology such as ML / AI has shown the
                                   promise of non-human intelligence through computation. More than ever, the borderline
                                   between human and object has become blurred. If there is a spectrum
                                   that measures the level of Human-ness vs. Object-ness, what lies in the middle
                                   ground? How close might an object endowed with a certain level of intelligence or
                                   consciousness be to a human?

                                   what its owner sees.

                                   The project concept is based on research in three domains: discoveries in physics and
                                   cosmology regarding the origin of life and human; the philosophical notions about our
                                   relationship of consciousness to the university as a whole; and related religious
                                   roots.

                                   Discoveries in physics and cosmology have brought forth the concept that humans, and
                                   all life and stuff on earth are star stuff––all born of the big bang. This has
                                   provided grounds for this project to discuss both the similarity in materiality
                                   between human and object, and the possibility of creating consciousness/intelligence
                                   in objects by understanding how the “human events” take place. Research into the
                                   theory of consciousness, or the philosophy of mind, provides a broader picture on the
                                   nature of consciousness that ranges from consciousness in matter (e.g. Panpsychism)
                                   to consciousness in machines (e.g Post-/Trans-humanism, Humanity+ and the coming AI
                                   take-over).

                                   connect human behaviors with object behaviors. Finally, research into related
                                   religious roots, including Buddhism and Shinto, allows this project to borrow the
                                   metaphor of gods/spirits that inhabit all entities and to build on top of these
                                   historical touchstones under the semi-human, semi-object theme with a contemporary

                                   I began my design by referencing a piece of artwork called Kotoba made by a Japanse
                                   artist Kimura Koichiro. He took a series of photographs of his family sleeping, and
                                   as you can see here, although he’s not in the picture, the imprints on the bedsheet
                                   gave away his existence.

                                   This gave me the idea of re-creating imprints. By putting a human body on top of a
                                   flat bedsheet, imprints can be made when the body is moving and rubbing against the
                                   fabric. Then when you take out the body, the imprints will be revealed.

                                   To find out what type of movements I should use to create the imprint, I recorded
                                   myself sleeping overnight, and narrowed down to three major categories: Side Curl,
                                   Laying Flat, and Roll-over.

                                   I tested with human-like objects, such as a wooden mannequin, to get an idea of the
                                   look and feel of human imprints. It made me realized the importance of having a
                                   structure with parts that are inherently connected.

                                   In this way, the impression of a
                                   human can be translated onto a piece of fabric thanks to the combinations of
                                   crumbles. It also helped me figure out which joints are necessary and which ones are
                                   not.

                                   Then I built a bed frame mounted with eight stepper motors. These steppers represent
                                   eight major joints on a human body- shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees.

                                   To figure out the mapping relationship between joint movement of a human skeleton and
                                   joint movement of the bedsheet, I calibrated my own movement with PoseNet and
                                   RealSense, and used it as a baseline to determine the range, velocity, and dynamics
                                   of the motors’ movements.

                                   movement tracking on top of the generated images. These movements were then recorded
                                   in MongoDB, and became the final dataset I used to drive the bedsheet.
