                                   expose the invisible thought cages we’ve built
                                   around ourselves. It uses a machine learning algorithm called Sentiment Analysis to
                                   analyze tweets on Twitter,
                                   generalize the public's attitudes about those tweets under different topics, and let
                                   people interact
                                   with them. It is a project co-created by me & <a

                              <p class="paragraph-text">The concept of this project is born from a late night talk
                                   between Tanic and I when we discussed about the impact of social media on our life.
                                   Nowadays, people spent tons of hours per day on social media, with or without
                                   noticing how their opinions and decision making process have been shaped in an
                                   insidious way. </p>
                              <p class="paragraph-text">In response, we think it would be interesting to build a
                                   mechanism to
                                   remind people of the opinion bubbles they live in, by allowing them to physically
                                   interact with one of the social media behemoths. In our case, we decided to use
                                   Twitter as our target platform, as summarized in the following video:</p>

                              <p class="paragraph-text">Once we’d decided to make an installation piece that allows
                                   people to interact with data on Twitter and reflect on it, we began to ideate
                                   possible interactions. Our goal is to engage users in a way that:
                              </p>

                                        <li>can relate them to the source of data they’re playing

                                             which is
                                             Twitter;</li>
                                        <li>is aesthetically pleasing and aligns with the Twitter bird metaphor;</li>
                                        <li>has different layers, in order to encourage multiple rounds of interaction,
                                             yet as
                                             simple and intuitive as possible to avoid confusion;</li>
                                        <li>is technically feasible given the 1 month timeframe</li>

                                   After several brainstorming sessions, we landed on the shadow play idea that would
                                   allow users to interact with an invisible Twitter bird in a bird cage. The invisible
                                   bird will represent a topic or a hashtag on Twitter, and the user will need to guess
                                   whether the public’s attitude about that topic is mostly positive or negative. The
                                   bird will then react according to the user’s input, allowing the user to reflect on
                                   that topic based on her/his guessing result.

                                   shadow appeared to be the most effective and feasible option, the position of light
                                   source (e.g. front vs. rear projection) and the position and pose of the user (e.g.
                                   at the front or at the sides, standing vs. sitting) created different effects and
                                   permitted/prohibited different user actions and physical setup.

                                   microphone at the front), while the
                                   tangible interface happened at the back (the cage & the projection backdrop are
                                   located behind the microphone).
                                   This created a discrepancy between the initial voice input and subsequent
                                   interactions, and required additional effort for the users to move on to the next
                                   step in the interaction flow.

                                   users, we decided to push the cage backwards (making it closer to the projection
                                   plane) and incorporate the microphone inside the cage. In this case, all interface
                                   are aligned at the same place, and users will be focused on the interaction with the
                                   cage. Also, we displayed speech recognition result to the users (The cage heard
                                   XXX), so that they can
                                   have immediate feedback of their voice input and thereby not losing patience.

                                   the user hovered her/his hand on. As the size of the light sensor was relatively
                                   small
                                   compared to the food container, it happened from time to time when its reading
                                   changes were not significant enough to capture a guessing intention.

                              <p class="paragraph-text">Solution: We doubled the amount of light sensors at both

                                   user’s hand approach the container, at least one of the sensors will pick out the
                                   action and trigger a guessing behavior. Also, instead of hovering the hand over the
                                   container, we would ask the users to actually feed the bird with an almond by
                                   throwing the almond into one of the food container. In this way, not only the users
                                   felt more like interacting with a real bird, the feeding action also added to the
                                   chance of intention capturing since it increased the time that the users’ hand was
                                   staying around the sensors.
